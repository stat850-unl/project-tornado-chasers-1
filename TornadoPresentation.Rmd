## Introduction

-   A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground, forming a funnel-shaped cloud, known as a tornado vortex.

Here are the goals of the data explore:

-   Data Analysis: Cleaning and Pre-processing

-   Tornado Trends and Patterns: Frequencies & intense over time, Investigate regional variations.

-   Tornado Impact Assessment: Assess the economic and human impact of tornadoes focusing on the geographical areas

-   Develop Shiny Application: Tornadoes in the United States

## 1. Explore the Tornado Dataset

-   It is sourced from NOAA's National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center Severe Weather Maps, Graphics and Data Page.

-   The data offers insights into the characteristics and impacts of tornadoes that have occurred from 1950 to 2022.

### Data Cleaning and Pre-processing

### Step I. Identify the data information

-   The "tornado" data set has 29 variables and 68,701 observations.

```{r, echo = F,message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)


data_discription <- data.frame(

                  "The date of the tornado occurrence",
                  "The time of day when the tornado was reported",

                  "The magnitude of the tornado, recorded on the F scale. EF scale from 2007. Some are estimated",
                  "The number of injuries associated with the tornado",
                  "The number of fatalities caused by the tornado",
                  "Estimated property loss information, with values grouped into ranges for years before 1996",
                  "The geographical coordinates of the tornado's starting point. (Starting latitude )",

                  "The length of the tornado's path",
                  "The width of the tornado's path",

)

kable(data_discription)

```

## 1. Explore the Tornado Dataset..cont

### Step II. Check for missing values in the data set

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

#read the data

tornado <-read.csv("https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/data/1950-2022_actual_tornadoes.csv")
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(tornado))

print(missing_values)

```

-   Output indicates that there are no missing values.

### Step III. Identify and Handling Inconsistent Values

-   Get the summary and Identify issues/considerations

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
summary(tornado)
```

## 1. Explore the Tornado Dataset..cont

### Issues/considerations

1.  "mag" (Magnitude) Column:

-   The minimum value is -9, which may be inconsistent since magnitude is typically a non-negative value.

**Identify rows which have negative magnitude.**

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Identify rows where magnitude is negative
library(tidyverse)

#read the data

tornado <-read.csv("https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/data/1950-2022_actual_tornadoes.csv")
negative_mag_rows <- tornado[tornado$mag < 0, ] 
mag_neg<-(negative_mag_rows[, c("om", "yr", "mo", "dy", "mag","fc")])


num_rows <- nrow(mag_neg)

print(paste('No of rows where magnitude is negative:', num_rows))


```

**Identify years where magnitude is negative.**

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
print(unique(negative_mag_rows$yr))

```

-   These rows seem to represent tornadoes from year 2016-2022 where the original magnitude ("mag") is listed as -9, and the "fc" value is set to 0, according to the modification scheme indicating that no modification was made for these tornadoes. ([Noaa](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/#data)) / [Info](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/OneTor_F-scale-modifications.pdf).

## 1. Explore the Tornado Dataset..cont

2.  "date" and "time" Columns:

-   Confirm that the "date" and "time" columns are correctly formatted as dates and times, respectively. (Date format="%Y-%m-%d", Time format="%H:%M:%S")

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Convert "date" to Date class
tornado$date <- as.Date(tornado$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")

# Convert "time" to POSIXct class
tornado$time <- as.POSIXct(tornado$time, format="%H:%M:%S")
head(tornado$time)

```

3.  "st" Column:

-   Create a separate column called "state_full" which have the full state name.

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

# Create a mapping between state abbreviations and full names
state_mapping <- c("AL" = "Alabama", "AK" = "Alaska", "AZ" = "Arizona", "AR" = "Arkansas", "CA" = "California",
                   "CO" = "Colorado", "CT" = "Connecticut", "DE" = "Delaware", "FL" = "Florida", "GA" = "Georgia",
                   "HI" = "Hawaii", "ID" = "Idaho", "IL" = "Illinois", "IN" = "Indiana", "IA" = "Iowa",
                   "KS" = "Kansas", "KY" = "Kentucky", "LA" = "Louisiana", "ME" = "Maine", "MD" = "Maryland",
                   "MA" = "Massachusetts", "MI" = "Michigan", "MN" = "Minnesota", "MS" = "Mississippi", "MO" = "Missouri",
                   "MT" = "Montana", "NE" = "Nebraska", "NV" = "Nevada", "NH" = "New Hampshire", "NJ" = "New Jersey",
                   "NM" = "New Mexico", "NY" = "New York", "NC" = "North Carolina", "ND" = "North Dakota", "OH" = "Ohio",
                   "OK" = "Oklahoma", "OR" = "Oregon", "PA" = "Pennsylvania", "RI" = "Rhode Island", "SC" = "South Carolina",
                   "SD" = "South Dakota", "TN" = "Tennessee", "TX" = "Texas", "UT" = "Utah", "VT" = "Vermont",
                   "VA" = "Virginia", "WA" = "Washington", "WV" = "West Virginia", "WI" = "Wisconsin", "WY" = "Wyoming")

# Add a new column with full state names
tornado$state_full <- state_mapping[tornado$st]

# Print the first few rows to verify
head(tornado[, c("st", "state_full")])

```
